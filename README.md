# Customer Data Analysis

**1. Datasets**

The datasets provided by KPMG consist of:
  1. Exisiting customer information
  2. Transactions
  3. New customer information who have not purchased products yet

**2.Model**

In order to identify high value customers, I used a method called RFM (Receny-Frequency-MonetaryValue) on the existing customer data.
The RFM served as my response variable in the Machine Learning Model. Because this is a classification problem, the best data mining techniques
are Classificaton Tree, Random Forrest and KNN. Based on the highest accuracy I deployed the model on the new customer data.

**3.Data Visualization**

Because our goal is to identify which customers to target, it helps to visualize the data and results.
I created a dashboard that contains which customers promise the highest value based on our machine learning model.
