# Customer Data Analysis

**1. Datasets **

The datasets provided by KPMG consist of exisiting customer information, a transaction worksheet and a worksheet containing information about new customers who have not purchased products yet. The idea is to create a ML model that can predict which customers have a high customer value and should be targeted. 
Based on my marketing knowledge, you can easily apply a method called RFM (Recency- Frequency- Monetary Value).
